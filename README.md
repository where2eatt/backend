# WHERE2EAT README

# Idea Overview

WHERE2Eat is an iOS app that will be used to help individuals, pairs, or groups schedule their meals by narrowing down dining options based on group preferences (such as dietary preferences) and availability. The goals of our project are to simplify the decision-making process for friend groups with keeping all dietary preferences in mind, to promote exploration of new restaurants and cuisines, to enhance group interaction and engagement, and to save time by providing all necessary information in one place.  


# Project Goals 
- Allow groups to find an ideal meal location for everyone
- Cater to dietary preferences so that everyone is able to enjoy the chosen place
- Motivate individuals to explore new cuisines and places they don't usually go to
- Find a restaurant that is at a location that is accessible and ideal for all in the group
