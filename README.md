# WHERE2EAT README

# Idea Overview:

WHERE2Eat is an iOS app that will be used to help individuals, pairs, or groups schedule their meals by narrowing down dining options based on group preferences (such as dietary preferences) and availability. The goals of our project are to simplify the decision-making process for friend groups with keeping all dietary preferences in mind, to promote exploration of new restaurants and cuisines, to enhance group interaction and engagement, and to save time by providing all necessary information in one place.
