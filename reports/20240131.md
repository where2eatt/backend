# Jan 31st Weekly Status Report


## Team Report (status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting)
#### Section 1: empty because this is the first week of status reports
#### Section 2:
    - what you did: 
        - Developed a basic structure for the system architecture and design
        - Met with our TA to figure out how wide we should scope our project in terms of utilizing data that is available 
        - Met in class and outside of class to create and maintain our Github repo
    - what worked:
        - Our team was able to meet at times that were ideal for everyone and everyone was present at these meetings 
        - We figured out that Discord is the ideal form of communication for our group 
    - what you learned:
        - Learned more about different types of system architectures, especially which one would suit our team’s project best
        - Learned how to create a good READ.ME and how to include information that could be useful to see on first glance 
    - where you had trouble:
        - Had some trouble with figuring out how exactly we will layout all the components of our system in our architecture diagram 
        - Had trouble figuring out how exactly we will work with the database in our system and which platforms would be best to use
    - where you are stuck
        - Currently learning more about Swift because that is the main technology we will use to create our app
#### Section 3
    - Goals:
        - By next week (Jan 31st), create a UI mockup for the app (Betty and Srushti)
            - Create at least 4 different landing screens by Jan 29
            - Create the next 4 screens by Jan 31
        - Figure out the exact screens we want to create by Jan 27th (Everyone)
        - Figure out the needed methods and backed setup by next week (Jan 31st)
            - Work on the methods for the first 4 screens by coordinating with the front-end team by Jan 29 (Adrien, Kevin, Aparna)
            - Work on the methods for the next 4 screens by coordinating with the front-end team by Jan 31 (Adrien, Kevin, Aparna)
    

## Individual Team Member Contributions:

#### Srushti:
    - Section 1: empty because this is the first week of status reports
    - Section 2:
        - what you did: helped create the basic system architecture on Figma, went to all team meetings (both in and outside of class) to help with creating the GitHub repo and talking more about the structure and design for our app 
        - what worked: the timings for the meetings worked and the delegation of tasks on assignments worked great 
        - what you learned: the split up of backend and front end knowledge has been really helpful since we are really capitalizing on everyone’s skills
        - where you had trouble:
        - where you are stuck: figuring out how to use swift to implement the front end.
    - Section 3:

#### Aparna:
    - Section 1: empty because this is the first week of status reports
    - Section 2:
        - what you did: helped create the basic system architecture through discussion, went to all team meetings (both in and outside of class) to help with creating the GitHub repo and talking more about the structure and design for our app
        - what worked: the timings for the meetings worked and the delegation of tasks on assignments worked great 
        - what you learned: the split up of backend and front end knowledge has been really helpful. Also it is cool to see how my knowledge of databases from my TA’ing job of a databases class has a lot of correlations to this. 
        - where you had trouble: had trouble with visualizing which databases would be ideal for our team’s needs
        - where you are stuck: what would the ideal way to set up our backend databases be
    - Section 3:
            - Figure out the exact screens we want to create by Jan 27th (Everyone)
            - Figure out the needed methods and backed setup by next week (Jan 31st)
                - Work on the methods for the first 4 screens by coordinating with the front-end team by Jan 29 (Adrien, Kevin, Aparna)
                - Work on the methods for the next 4 screens by coordinating with the front-end team by Jan 31 (Adrien, Kevin, Aparna)
#### Adrien:
    - Section 1: empty because this is the first week of status reports
    - Section 2:
        - what you did: helped create the basic system architecture through discussion, went to all team meetings (both in and outside of class) to help with creating the GitHub repo, researched deeply about the databases for our app that we could use
        - what worked: the timings for the meetings worked and the delegation of tasks on assignments worked great 
        - what you learned: knowledge of databases combined with what my peers also know has helped us navigate the backend development process with more ease
        - where you had trouble: figuring out how to combine the different system architectures to best suit our team’s needs
        - where you are stuck: what would the ideal way to set up our backend databases be
    - Section 3:

#### Betty:
