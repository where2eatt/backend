# Jan 31st Weekly Status Report

## Team Report (status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting)
#### Section 1 
    - empty because this is the first week of status reports
#### Section 2
    - What We Did: 
        - Developed a basic structure for the system architecture and design
        - Met with our TA to figure out how wide we should scope our project in terms of utilizing data that is available 
        - Met in class and outside of class to create and maintain our Github repo and delegated tasks how on to work on the project
    - What Worked:
        - Our team was able to meet at times that were ideal for everyone and everyone was present at these meetings 
        - We figured out that Discord is the ideal form of communication for our group 
    - What We Learned:
        - Learned more about different types of system architectures, especially which one would suit our team’s project best
        - Learned how to create a good READ.ME and how to include information that could be useful to see on first glance 
    - Where We Had Trouble:
        - Had some trouble with figuring out how exactly we will layout all the components of our system in our architecture diagram 
        - Had trouble figuring out how exactly we will work with the database in our system and which platforms would be best to use
    - Where We Are Stuck:
        - Currently learning more about Swift because that is the main technology we will use to create our app
#### Section 3
    - Goals:
        - By next week (Jan 31st), create a UI mockup for the app (Betty and Srushti)
            - Create at least 4 different landing screens by Jan 29th
            - Create the next 4 screens by Jan 31st
        - Figure out the exact screens we want to create by Jan 27th (Everyone)
        - Figure out the needed methods and backed setup by next week (Jan 31st)
            - Work on the methods for the first 4 screens by coordinating with the front-end team by Jan 29th (Adrien, Kevin, Aparna)
            - Work on the methods for the next 4 screens by coordinating with the front-end team by Jan 31st (Adrien, Kevin, Aparna)
    - Plan for project Meeting on Jan 25th
        - Meet with the TA to discuss our current updates and system architechture diagram 
        - Figure out the main screens we want to design so we can get started on the subsequent part
        - Make sure the Architechture and Design assignment is ready to submit and submit it
    - Bigger Picture: Finish UI prototyping and start full fledge development by the end of the month (Jan 31st). Next goals also consist of researching more databse systems and which one would suit our needs ideally and set it up. 
    

## Individual Team Member Contributions:

#### Srushti
##### Section 1 
        - empty because this is the first week of status reports
##### Section 2
        - What You Did: helped create the basic system architecture on Figma, went to all team meetings (both in and outside of class) to help with creating the GitHub repo and talking more about the structure and design for our app 
        - What Worked: the timings for the meetings worked and the delegation of tasks on assignments worked great 
        - What You Learned: the split up of backend and front end knowledge has been really helpful since we are really capitalizing on everyone’s skills
        - Where You Had Trouble:
        - Where You Are Stuck: figuring out how to use Swift to implement the front end
##### Section 3
            - By next week (Jan 31st), create a UI mockup for the app (Betty and Srushti)
                - Create at least 4 different landing screens by Jan 29th

        - What Worked: the timings for the meetings worked and the delegation of tasks on assignments worked great 
        - What You Learned: the split up of backend and front end knowledge has been really helpful. Also it is cool to see how my knowledge of databases from my TA’ing job of a databases class has a lot of correlations to this. 
        - Where You Had Trouble: had trouble with visualizing which databases would be ideal for our team’s needs
        - Where You Are Stuck: what would the ideal way to set up our backend databases be
